# ScreenPaste

A lightweight Windows screenshot, annotation and screen-recording tool: capture in one press, annotate instantly, pin to your screen, and record any region to GIF / MP4 / WebP.

## Features

### Capture
- The whole screen (multi-monitor support)
- **Automatic window & UI-element detection**: hover over a window or an interface element (buttons, panels, web-page blocks) to outline it, then click to capture; scroll the **mouse wheel** to switch the detection level (element ⇄ window)
- Drag to select a custom region, with a size readout; a **pixel magnifier** follows the cursor throughout (framing and editing) with a crosshair, coordinates and the pixel color — `C` copies the color value, `Shift` toggles hex/decimal
- **Adjustable after selecting**: drag the corner and edge-midpoint handles to resize; with no tool active, drag inside the region to move it — existing annotations stay pinned to the content

### Annotate
After capturing, an **icon toolbar** pops up next to the cursor (draggable, and it steers clear of screen edges):

- **Marker** — solid strokes with adjustable thickness / color / opacity
- **Highlighter** — semi-transparent overlay color with adjustable thickness / color / opacity
- **Text** — choose font / size / color / style (normal, bold, italic, strikethrough); clicking outside the box commits it
- **Shapes** — rectangle / rounded rectangle / ellipse, outlined or filled, with adjustable line thickness and color
- **Line / arrow** — drag to draw; each end can be toggled to an arrowhead; adjustable thickness and color; hold `Shift` to snap to 45° angles
- **Stickers** — paste PNG / JPEG / WebP images, drag to move, scroll to resize
- **Blur** — Gaussian blur / mosaic with adjustable strength; painted above every annotation, so a region hides the strokes and shapes under it, and it can be dragged to a new spot (it re-samples whatever it now covers)
- **Magnifier** — drag to frame the area to enlarge and an enlarged view is placed next to it: rectangle / rounded / circle, with adjustable zoom (1.2–10×), border thickness and colour, connector, shadow, smoothing (off gives the hard pixel grid), and whether the enlarged content includes other annotations; the view can be dragged anywhere (its frame and connector keep pointing at the original area) and the wheel re-zooms it while selected
- **Direct select / move** — hover any placed annotation and **drag it right away**; `Delete` removes it; moves and deletes are undoable
- **Color picker** — Hex input, RGB and opacity (translucent colors preview over a checkerboard); custom colors are remembered across sessions, right-click a swatch to remove it
- **Undo / Redo** — via buttons and hotkeys; every slider shows a live numeric readout

### Output
- Copy to clipboard
- Save as PNG / JPG (save as, or quick-save to a default folder)
- **Pin to screen**: the image floats on top; drag it, scroll to resize, right-click for a menu; with multiple pins, Esc closes the focused one first, or closes them all when none is focused

### Region recording
- A dedicated global hotkey (**F2** by default): drag-select the region to record, or **click a window to auto-detect it** (wheel cycles window/element levels, just like capture), press again (or click Stop) to finish
- A red frame marks the region while recording, with a small pill bar showing the timer and a Stop button
- After recording, an **editor** opens: looping preview, timeline trim handles (`Space` to play, `←`/`→` frame stepping, `I`/`O` to set trim in/out), and export with a progress bar
- **Drag the red frame's border to move the recording region mid-recording** — the interior stays fully interactive
- The editor has the same **annotation tools** as captures (text / shapes / line-arrow / stickers / gaussian blur / mosaic, with full option rows; annotations drag directly, `Delete` removes); `Ctrl+C` quick-exports and puts the file on the clipboard
- Export as **GIF / MP4 / WebP**, switchable right in the editor; a setting can skip the editor and save immediately
- Optional mouse-cursor capture, frame rate 10–30 fps
- **Audio**: system sound (loopback) / microphone / both mixed, selectable in settings; sound is saved only in **MP4** (GIF and WebP are silent). With no usable audio device (common over remote desktop) it falls back to a silent recording
- Encoded by the bundled `ffmpeg` — no separate install required

### More
- Global hotkeys (**F1** capture, **F2** recording, both configurable) and launch from the **system tray** icon
- **Multiple languages**: Traditional Chinese / English / 日本語 / 한국어 / Français / Deutsch / Español (follows the system by default)
- **Light / Dark / Follow system** theme, with a modern rounded UI and dark title bars
- A centralized **Settings window**: language, hotkeys, theme, run at startup, save folder, recording format / frame rate (hotkey fields are set by simply pressing the combination)
- Optional **run automatically at startup**
- **Auto-update**: checks for new versions via GitHub Releases (toggle in settings, or check manually); one click to download and install

## Install

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/taida957789/ScreenPaste/releases):

- **`ScreenPaste-<version>-setup.exe`** — installer (no administrator rights required, installs to `%APPDATA%\ScreenPaste`, includes a Start menu shortcut and an uninstaller)
- **`ScreenPaste-<version>-win-x64-portable.zip`** — portable, no-install version

Both are self-contained — **no separate .NET Runtime is required**, and `ffmpeg` (for region recording) is bundled.

## Quick start

![Toolbar](screenshots/ui.png)

1. Once launched it stays in the system tray; press **F1** (or double-click the tray icon) to start a capture.
2. Hover over a window or UI element to auto-outline it and click to capture, or drag to select a custom region.
3. Pick a tool from the pop-up toolbar, adjust its parameters, and annotate on the selection.
4. Press **Copy / Save / Pin** to output; `Esc` leaves the capture (asks first, with a don't-ask-again option).

Recording: press **F2** and drag-select a region to start; press **F2** again (or click Stop) to finish, then preview, trim and export as GIF/MP4/WebP in the editor (a setting can save immediately instead).

## Hotkeys

All settings (hotkeys, tool defaults, theme, run at startup, recording format / frame rate, and so on) can be adjusted from the tray menu → "Settings…" window.

> Building from source: run `scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.ps1` once to download the bundled `ffmpeg.exe` (CI does this automatically on release).
